# timeCardPunches

Use this program to upload time cards into Oracle HCM Cloud staging table(s).

## Getting started
Punches are one of the critical piece in the implementation of Oracle HCM Cloud application. If we miss any punches then that will affect the payroll as well. We all know if we miss any payroll data then how big the impact would be. So this application will help the end user to load and test the punches into Oracle HCM Cloud application. This also can be easily implemented in Production as well.
